# File containing point set of an epsilon neighboorhood graph being a triangle.

Space_Dim = 2;  # Dimension of space indicating amount of coordinates of points.
Epsilon   = 2;  # Distance below (or equal to) which two points are connected.


# After "POINTS:" the coordinates of the points have to appear. That is, the next lines conatain one
# point and therefore "Space_Dimension" numbers.
