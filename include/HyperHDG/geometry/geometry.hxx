 * \brief   A namespace containing classes describing hypergraph geometries.
 *
 * \todo    Discuss, whether we want to use array or SmallVec in internals.
 *
 * One of the advantages of this software package is the strict discrimination between the topology
 * and the geometry of the domain \f$\Omega\f$. Thus, one can exemplarily define a single topology
 * (the one of a cube) to approximate PDEs that live on the cube's boundary and PDEs that live on a
 * sphere, since their topology is the same. However, different geometries have to be defined, since
 * these obviously are not equal. Thus, all parts of the code that involve communication and/or
 * solving systems of equations are reusable in a much more general (than the standard) sense.
 * Beyond that, absurd (on first sight) domains can be defined easily. This also covers variously
 * periodic domains, for example.
