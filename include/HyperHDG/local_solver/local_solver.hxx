 * \brief   A namespace for local solvers.
 *
 * Local solvers contain the information on the partial differential equation (PDE) which will be
 * solved on the hypergraph. Thus, they can be considered the core classes which have to be written
 * for all kinds of mathematical problems.
 *
 * There are some functions that the global loops require the local solvers to provide. For more
 * details on this consider the corresponding global loop type and the \c Template solver.
